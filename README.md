# ABSTRACT
Machine Learning (ML) in games are mainly used in three major areas: Testing of ML in game, using ML for games AI and using the ML for the asset of the game. These are the major areas where all the interest has rested and use of ML as the games main mechanic has been less investigated. This can probably be attributed to the lack of computers not capable of handling real time learning capabilities and gaming community not having these model for use in game. Some of these simulations of gaming like experience do exist and uses ML to achieve it, but these are just experiences and do not provide wide variety of interaction and restrict the user from the initial setup.
This paper will create a multi-player racing game prototype where the player is racing against AI opponents where their base parameters are set, and their behavior is dictated by the Neural-Network (NN). This work will describe what sort of decisions were made with some consideration and compromises to create a good gaming experience for the player. The prototype being designed will be used to showcase that creative and inspiring game design can be created using ML and will aid the design opportunities and research in the future.
Keywords: Machine-Learning, Neural-Network, Artificial Intelligence, Game Design.
